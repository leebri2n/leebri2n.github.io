            Ever since their introduction in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow and colleagues,
            generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been a popular subject of study
            in the field of generative modeling methods. They have gained particular
            popularity in the community because of the relatively heightened realism
            and originality of the samples they can generate.

            <br> <br>
            Despite the exciting results GANs have achieved, the training process is
            often challenging, fraught with known pitfalls resulting in poor model
            behavior. Some of these training failures occur by the adversarial
            nature of the model's two networks, in which one model's performance comes
            at the expense of the other. Other training failures arise from computational
            constraints. Not only does training time need to be long enough, but
            sufficiently diverse and abundant training data is required to produce
            realistic results.

            <br> <br>
            In this project, I worked with my supervisor Logan Eisenbeiser to study
            how to train GANs capable of realistic image generation with shorter training time
            and with less data by way of transfer learning.
            Transfer learning is the method of continuing the training of a pretrained
            network on a new dataset, a target domain.

            Firstly, we desired a way to curate small datasets of images. To do so,
            we created a data pipeline to automate the scraping of images and filtering
            of images. For the scraping portion of the pipeline, we scraped images
            from public Instagram posts by hashtag using the Python Instascrape package.
            Images from Instagram emulate the kind of variability that would exist in domains
            limited by specifiicity or an abundance of examples.

            <br><br>
            After scraping and storing these images, the filter portion of a pipeline
            would sort through the raw dataset and discard poor training examples or those
            with elements difficult for the GAN to train with. This entails only keeping
            images of a sufficient resolution, sharpness, and automatically rejecting
            images that contain text, human faces, or are grayscale. What is left behind
            is a small dataset ready for training.

            Next, training experiments were then run on Virginia Tech Advanced Research
            Computing (ARC) GPU clusters. We used NVIDIA's StyleGAN3 model, a GAN model
            known for being adept at differentiating alternate styles of generated images.
            Using batch jobs of Python scripts, GANs were trained using found hyperparameters,
            a chosen network, dataset, and training length.

            <br> <br>
            Performance of these trained GANs and the realism of their generations are
            measured by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score that measures the
            distance between the real and generated images. The model generates examples
            at snapshots in the training process to assemble performance metrics throughout training.
