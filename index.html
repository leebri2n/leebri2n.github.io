                      Hello, my name is Brian Lee and I am a young research professional graduated 
                      from Virginia Tech in 2023 with a Bachelor's of Science in Computational Modeling 
                      and Data Analytics with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics.
                      <b><b></b>
                      During my time as a student research assistant, intern, and most recently 
                      as a research data analyst with the Virginia Tech National Security Institute, my 
                      research experience consists of developing software tools to process, manipulate, and 
                      analyze data related to problems of the test and evaluation of AI-enabled systems.
                      <b><b></b>
                      While my research experience in the sphere of machine learning are indispensible, my

                     <p>
                        Coverage of Data Explorer, or CODEX, is a Python package that implements data coverage metrics and algorithms 
                        for artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) test and evaluation (T&E) applications. CODEXâ€™s metrics 
                        are based on the theory of combinatorial testing (CT) adapted from software testing to AI/ML T&E with a 
                        data-centric focus.
                        <br> <br>
                        Released to the public in October 2024, CODEX allows a user to assess study a tabular dataset of their choice 
                        in various of modes of exploration that each examine a different aspect of the its contents on a combinatorial level. 
                        Different modes also leverage additional data such as model performance and split configurations to uncover additional 
                        insights on the datasets and its use in machine learning applications.

                      <h3>Transfer Learning in GAN Training</h3>
                      <p>
                          Training effective generative adversarial networks (GANs) from scratch is often a challenge 
                          in terms of training. Not only is the training process costly in time and computational resources, 
                          but datasets of insufficient sizes often encounter training failures.
                          <br> <br>
                          This project evaluates both the efficacy and efficiency of transfer learning as a viable method
                          in the realm of generative AI and on limited datasets of images assembled from an open source dataset 
                          such as Instagram. My first discusses these findings in the June 2023 edition of the ITEA Journal of 
                          Test and Evaluation.

                        <p>
                           To understand the special relationship between a protein's amino acid
                           sequence and its function, today's bioengineers have turned to
                           machine learning approaches to model these structures accurately. While models exhibit strong
                           predictive power, their weights and outputs lack explainability, including what, if any, 
                           biological semantics are being learned. This project explores
                           whether or not latent outputs of protein sequences learned by machine learning models
                           are similar or different.

                        <p>
                           Precise and large-scale simulations have their own trade-off with
                           computational limits. Such programs can be processed in parallel,

                        <p>
                           Washington Capitals elite Alexander Ovechkin has taken second place for all-time career
                           goals scored in NHL history and shows no sign of slowing down. Although it is known he has
                           a talent for scoring goals, game data suggests that he is in a league of his own entirely.
                           <br> <br>
                           This being one of my earliest personal projects, I use basic data preprocessing and statistical methods
                           to extract characteristics and patterns in Ovechkin's goal-scoring. They are subsequently
                           used in striking and creative visualizations to easily convey his unmatched proficency when
                           compared to his peers leaguewide.
