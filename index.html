          <p>
            My name is Brian Lee and I am a 2023 alumnus graduated from
            Virginia Tech with a Bachelor's of Science in Computational Modeling
            and Data Analytics (CMDA) and minors in computer science and mathematics.

            My interests lie in the use of data science techniques in physical science
            problems, including bioinformatics and physics. In addition, I am interested
            in applying data science techniques to develop the understanding on machine
            learning methods to become safe, effective, and efficient tools of the future.
            <br><br>
            My experience consists of data visualization, data analysis of complex
            high dimensional datasets, and the design of software tools that aid
            the research process such as data pipelines or visualization modules.
            <b><b>
            My coursework is diverse and interdisciplinary in computer science,
            mathematics, and statistics. My cirriculum favors courses focused
            on math modeling methods in dynamical systems, matrix theory, and
            modeling solutions to partial differential equations.

              <h3>Transfer Learning in GAN Training</h3>
              <p>
                Training effective generative adversarial networks (GANs) from scratch can often be a challenge.
                Not only is the training process costly in time and computational resources, but datasets of
                even slightly insufficient sizes encounter siginificant training failures.
                <br> <br>
                This project evaluates both the efficacy and efficiency of transfer learning as a viable method
                of training generative adversarial networks (GANs) on limited datasets of images assembled from
                Instagram. A paper on my results submitted to the ITEA Journal of Test and Evaluation was approved
                for the June 2023 issue.

              <h3>Combinatorial Coverage for Dataset Exploration Tool</h3>
              <p>
                When pursuiing model generalization, the role of combinatorial interactions
                between features present in a datset is often overlooked. Intuitively, a dataset
                that covers a larger portion of possible feature combinations trains a more
                robust model, as described by the combinatorial coverage metric.
                <br> <br>
                This project aimed to create a dataset explorer program that integrates splitting
                of the dataset, model training and testing, and visualizes the
                relationship between combinatorial coverage and model performance.

              <h3>Comparing Latent Space Representations of Protein Sequenceing Models</h3>
              <p>
                To understand the special relationship between a protein's amino acid
                sequence and its function, bioengineers of today have turned to
                machine learning approaches to model it. While models exhibit strong
                predictive power, their weights and outputs lack any biological semantics being learned.
                <br> <br>
                This CMDA capstone project was conducted under the sponsorship of the National Institute of Standards
                and Technology (NIST) and completed by me and three other CMDA undergraduate teammates explores
                whether or not latent outputs of protein sequences learned by machine learning models
                are similar or different.

              <h3>Game of Life using Message Passing Interface</h3>
              <p>
                Precise and large-scale simulations have their own trade-off with
                computational limits. Such programs can be processed in parallel,
                but just how much added benefit is gained by doing so?

                <br> <br>
                In this project for Computer Science Foundations of CMDA (CMDA3634)
                at Virginia Tech, I implement and study the benefits of using
                parallel computing through scalability studies.

              <h3>Alex Ovechkin Goal-Scoring Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization</h3>
              <p>
                Washington Capitals elite Alexander Ovechkin has taken second place for all-time career
                goals scored in NHL history and shows no sign of slowing down. Although it is known he has
                a talent for scoring goals, game data suggests that he is in a league of his own entirely.

                <br> <br>
                In one of my earliest personal projects, I use basic data preprocessing and statistical methods
                to extract characteristics and patterns in Ovechkin's goal-scoring. They are subsequently
                used in striking and creative visualizations to easily convey his unmatched proficency when
                compared to his peers leaguewide.
